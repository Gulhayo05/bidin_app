# bidin_app
This is a a platform where users can bid on rare auto license plates. Each plate is unique, and users compete by placing bids. The highest bid wins the plate when bidding ends. The project emphasizes basic DRF concepts like authentication, serializers, and permissions, with a simple bidding mechanism.
